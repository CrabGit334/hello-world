# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository -- a start of my coding journey.

Today in March 9th, gusty outside. But I was brave enough to walk to the nearby Starbucks, just for a coffee. Cafeine is definitely a must to start a day's work. 

Here is a link by Unidata to introduce the git and github for beginners -- https://unidata.github.io/online-python-training/
